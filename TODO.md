- Continue stripping master branch material into here
- Look at issues on Rebane repo
- check noobline counted into materials count
- hall of fame
- in future add edit mode for nbts for colour replacements etc: issue #124
- mapCanvasWorker.jsworker accurate support block count
- "optimised" staircase
- mapdat transparency; slider
- mapdat mode: don't show materials
- CLI
- Optimise renders; orange wool -> orange concrete doesn't need another render if selectedcolours is no longer locked in `currentMaterialsData` in `mapartController.js`
