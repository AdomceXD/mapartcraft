- Continue stripping master branch material into here
- Look at issues on Rebane repo
- hall of fame
- in future add edit mode for nbts for colour replacements etc: issue #124
- "optimised" (valley) staircase
- CLI
- staircase mode documentation
- Optimise renders; orange wool -> orange concrete doesn't need another render if selectedcolours is no longer locked in `currentMaterialsData` in `mapartController.js`
- review locale jsons and `EN:` prefix, also strings such as preprocessing background "Off" etc can be obtained from existing locale strings
- refactor double switch statements in `nbt.jsworker`?
- linear / none interpolation option for small uploads if easy
